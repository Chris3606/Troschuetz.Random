Troschuetz.Random
=================

All the hard work behind this library was done by Stefan Trosch√ºtz, and for which I thank him very much. What I have done with his great project, was simply to refactor and improve his code, while offering a new Python-style random class.

Please visit the [page of the original project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15102/NET-random-number-generators-and-distributions) in order to get an overview of the contents of this library. Unluckily, linked article also contains the only documentation available.
